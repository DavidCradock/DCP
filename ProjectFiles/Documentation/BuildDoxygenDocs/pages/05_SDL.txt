<h2>SDL - Simple Directmedia Layer library</h2>
<pre>
Here, we explain why we use the SDL library and how it was obtained and how it's used.
Here's what SDL has to say about itself...

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software,
emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog
and many Humble Bundle games.

<h3>SDL Source code download</h3>
<pre>
All the SDL libraries' source code, including the main one itself was downloaded from https://github.com/libsdl-org
We clicked upon the project, then releases and downloaded the source.zip file for the project.
We chose to use the source code instead of the pre-compiled libraries as, although it is more effort to compile the things ourselves, gives us more control over the configuration of the library and
makes sure that in the future, if we update our compiler/linker/etc, the source will recompile specifically for those tools.
</pre>

<h3>SDL Source code setup</h3>
<pre>
We download the sourcecode for the library, extract and place in /ProjectFiles/DynamicLibs/SDL2-2.30.6/ (Or similar depending upon version)
The same is done for the other various SDL libs such as SDL_Mixer and friends.
The downloaded source folder actually has precompiled .lib and .dll files which we could use, but 
</pre>

<h3>SDL automatic copying of compiled dlls to executable folder</h3>
<pre>
For our applications to run, the SDL2.dll needs to be located next to the compiled executables. We tell Visual studio to copy that dll file found in /Output/DynamicLibs/SDL2.dll to the
executable directory by right clicking upon the SDL project, properties, Build events, Post-build event, and setting the command line to...
xcopy /y /d $(SolutionDir)Output\DynamicLibs\SDL2.dll $(SolutionDir)Output\\Executables\\ for the release build and
xcopy /y /d $(SolutionDir)Output\DynamicLibs\SDL2_DEBUG.dll $(SolutionDir)Output\\Executables\\ for the debug build
</pre>
