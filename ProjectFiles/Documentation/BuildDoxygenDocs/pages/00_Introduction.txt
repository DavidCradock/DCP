<h2>Welcome to DCP's documentation!</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<pre>
DCP is an abbreviation for <b>D</b>ave's <b>C</b>ode <b>P</b>aradise.

DCP is a collection of dynamic libraries, static libraries and executable projects which link to them.

DCP has a solution file for Visual Studio, found in the root directory called "DCP.sln", which contains a main static library project and multiple executable projects which link to it.

The main static library is called "DavesCodeLibrary" or DCL for short.

The executables are used to develop DCL, show examples of how to use it, test various parts out to make sure they're working as expected. Some are also custom created tools such as font file generation.

DCL is a collection of code which includes (or will do) features such as...
- Opening a window.
- Access to input devices such as keyboard, mouse and various joysticks.
- AI, including neural networks, finite state machines and steering/flocking.
- Audio playback and maybe recording with various effects such as reverb, delay etc.
- Graphics rendering using either OpenGL, Software based or Vulkan.
- Image handling (loading/saving/manipulation with filters etc)
- Mathematics for vectors, matricies, planes, quaternions etc
- Networking, both TCP and UDP
- Physics, probably using other people's physics engines such as Box2D and Bullet and then later, my own rigid/soft body simulation.
- Spatial partitioning for both 2D (Quad tree) and 3D (Oct tree)

DCL is being created to allow me to create all kinds of cool stuff such as 2D and 3D hardware accelerated games and applications.

To get started, I recommend viewing the \ref 01_GettingStarted page which can be viewed by clicking on it on the tree view to the left, or of course the reference link generated by Doxygen.
