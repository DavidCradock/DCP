\doxysubsection*{SDL -\/ Simple Directmedia Layer library}


\begin{DoxyPre}
This page explains why we use the SDL library and how it was obtained and how it's used.
Here's what SDL has to say about itself...

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-\/platform development library designed
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software,
emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog
and many Humble Bundle games.

\doxysubsubsection*{Source code download}


\begin{DoxyPre}
All the SDL libraries' source code, including the main one itself was downloaded from \href{https://github.com/libsdl-org}{\texttt{ https://github.com/libsdl-\/org}}
We clicked upon the project, then releases and downloaded the source.zip file for the project.
We chose to use the source code instead of the pre-\/compiled libraries as, although it is more effort to compile the things ourselves, gives us more control over the configuration of the library and
makes sure that in the future, if we update our compiler/linker/etc, the source will recompile specifically for those tools.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{Source code setup}


\begin{DoxyPre}
We download the sourcecode for the library, extract and place in /ProjectFiles/DynamicLibs/SDL2-\/2.30.6/ (Or similar depending upon version)
The same is done for the other various SDL libs such as SDL\_Mixer and friends.
The downloaded source folder actually has precompiled .lib and .dll files which we could use, but 
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{Automatic copying of compiled dlls to executable folder}


\begin{DoxyPre}
For our applications to run, the SDL2.dll needs to be located next to the compiled executables. We tell Visual studio to copy that dll file found in /Output/DynamicLibs/SDL3/SDL2.dll to the
executable directory by adding the dll file inside the resources filter in the solution explorer of the DCLDevApp project, right clicking and setting the "{}item type"{} to Copy file.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{Additional SDL libs}


\begin{DoxyPre}
We also use several other SDL "{}support"{} libraries. These are...
SDL\_image-\/release-\/2.8.2 = Image file format loading/saving
SDL\_mixer-\/release-\/2.8.0 = Audio mixer playback
SDL\_net-\/release-\/2.2.0 = TCP/IP network code
SDL\_ttf-\/release-\/2.22.0 = True type font
SDL\_rtf-\/main = Rich Text Format file rendering
\end{DoxyPre}
