\doxysubsubsection*{What is it?}


\begin{DoxyPre}
DCP is an abbreviation for {\bfseries{D}}ave's {\bfseries{C}}ode {\bfseries{P}}aradise.

DCP is a collection of dynamic libraries, static libraries and executable projects which link to them.

DCP has a solution file for Visual Studio, found in the root directory called "{}DCP.sln"{}, which contains a main static library project and multiple executable projects which link to it.

The main static library is called "{}DavesCodeLibrary"{} or \doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL} for short.

The executables are used to develop \doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL}, show examples of how to use it, test various parts out to make sure they're working as expected. Some are also custom created tools such as font file generation.

\doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL} is a collection of code which includes (or will do) features such as...
-\/ Opening a window.
-\/ Access to input devices such as keyboard, mouse and various joysticks.
-\/ AI, including neural networks, finite state machines and steering/flocking.
-\/ Audio playback and maybe recording with various effects such as reverb, delay etc.
-\/ Graphics rendering using either OpenGL, Software based or Vulkan.
-\/ Image handling (loading/saving/manipulation with filters etc)
-\/ Mathematics for vectors, matricies, planes, quaternions etc
-\/ Networking, both TCP and UDP
-\/ Physics, probably using other people's physics engines such as Box2D and Bullet and then later, my own rigid/soft body simulation.
-\/ Spatial partitioning for both 2D (Quad tree) and 3D (Oct tree)

\doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL} is being created to allow me to create all kinds of cool stuff such as 2D and 3D hardware accelerated games and applications.

To get started, I recommend viewing the \doxysectlink{01__getting_started}{Getting Started.}{0} page which can be viewed by clicking on it on the tree view to the left, or of course the reference link generated by Doxygen.
