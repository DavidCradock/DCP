\begin{DoxyPre}
Here's some information of DCP's directory layout.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
The root directory containing a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file "{}DCP.sln"{} containing all projects found in /ProjectFiles/.
Load this solution file to build all libraries, documentation and executables.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Build\+Temp/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Where the temporary build files such as .obj, .log, .lastbuildstate, get placed.
It's just nice and tidy to have all the temporary files placed here for easy deletion.
The folder has four subfolders for each of the project types and those are...
/BuildTemp/Documentation Files related to Doxygen generated documentation
/BuildTemp/DynamicLibs Files related to dynamic libraries used by DCP
/BuildTemp/Executables Files related to executable projects of DCP
/BuildTemp/StaticLibs Files related to static library projects of DCP
Each of the projects located inside the /ProjectFiles directory use the above folders when they are being built.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Other/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Contains a few sub directories...
/Other/Reference/ Reference material is located such as articles, books etc which I read and use whilst learning new stuff to add to DCP.
/Other/SDKs/ Software development kit installers such as the VulkanSDK
/Other/Support/ Contains support files, for things like Blender project files for creating images etc.
/Other/CMake/ Contains CMake, although we try to avoid this thing as much as possible, we use it to create temporary project files for various source code downloads of various projects from github
to see how the developers of the various libraries set things up by looking at the CMake generated project files in a temporary folder. We then use this knowledge to create our own project files to
build the libraries ourselves.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Output/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Contains four subfolders for each of the project types and those are...
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{/\+Output/\+Documentation/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Contains the documentation which is generated from the comments inside the sourcecode for \doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL}, as well as several files which are located inside /ProjectFiles/Documentation/BuildDoxygenDocs/pages/
See \doxysectlink{03__doxygen_documentation}{Doxygen Documentation.}{0} page for more information of why I chose to use Doxygen.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{/\+Output/\+Dynamic\+Libs}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Where dynamic libraries are output to once built.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{/\+Output/\+Executables}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Where executables are output to once built.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{/\+Output/\+Executables/\+Data}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Data required by the various executables at their runtime are stored here. Files such as .mp3/.ogg/.wav/.png/.jpg etc.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{/\+Output/\+Static\+Libs}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Where static libraries are output to once built.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Project\+Files/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Contains each project file used to compile either documentation, dlls, executables or static libraries.
Each project folder contains each project's source files and the project file itself.
They are placed inside one of the four folder types depending upon what type of project they are. These four sub folders are...
/ProjectFiles/Documentation Files related to Doxygen generated documentation
/ProjectFiles/DynamicLibs Files related to dynamic libraries used by DCP
/ProjectFiles/Executables Files related to executable projects of DCP
/ProjectFiles/StaticLibs Files related to static library projects of DCP
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Project\+Files/\+GLFW}


\begin{DoxyPre}
GLFW is an Open Source, multi-\/platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.
GLFW is written in C and supports Windows, macOS, Wayland and X11.

\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Project\+Files/\+Open\+GL}


\begin{DoxyPre}
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-\/platform application programming interface (API) used for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
Essentially, it's a set of tools that allows programmers to communicate with a computer's graphics hardware (like a GPU) to create visual content.

\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/\+Project\+Files/\+SDL2-\/2.30.\+6}


\begin{DoxyPre}
About SDL

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-\/platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and
graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games. 

\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/external\+\_\+libs/\+Vulkan\+SDK}


\begin{DoxyPre}
The Vulkan SDK is a collection of essential tools used by developers to assist in development and debugging of Vulkan applications.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/projects/\+DCL/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Dave's Code Library.
A static library containing the bulk of all my code which the other executable projects link to.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/projects/\+Example\+CLog/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
An executable to show usage and test the \doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL} lib's CLog class used for logging.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{/projects/\+DCLDev\+App/}


\begin{DoxyPre}
An executable project used whilst developing the static library project \doxylink{namespace_d_c_l}{DCL}.
\end{DoxyPre}
