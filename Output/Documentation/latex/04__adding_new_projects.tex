\doxysubsection*{Adding new projects to the main DCP solution file.}


\begin{DoxyPre}
This text file details steps on how we add new project files to the main DavesCodingParadise Visual studio solution file.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{The main solution file which builds everything.}


\begin{DoxyPre}
The root directory contains a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file "{}DCP.sln"{} containing all projects found in /ProjectFiles/.
Load this solution file and perform a batch build to build all libraries, documentation and executables.
The solution file has four filters/folders Documentation, DynamicLibs, Executables and StaticLibs.
When adding a new project to the solution, you can choose to create a project where ever you like, but when adding a project, depending upon it's type, should be placed inside one of those filters to keep things tidy.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsubsection*{Adding a new executable project.}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Right click upon the Executables filter found within the solution explorer window, "{}Add...New Project"{} and select "{}Empty Project"{}.
Place new project in "{}/ProjectFiles/Executables"{} directory.
Right click upon the new project in solution explorer, click upon "{}Properties"{}
Make sure "{}Configuration"{} in the top left of the window is set to "{}All configurations"{} and set...

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/General/\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Output\ Directory"{}}\ set\ to\ \$(SolutionDir)Output\(\backslash\)Executables\(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/General/\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Intermediate\ Directory"{}}\ set\ to\ \$(SolutionDir)BuildTemp\(\backslash\)Executables\(\backslash\)\$(ProjectName)\(\backslash\)\$(Platform)\(\backslash\)\$(Configuration)\(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/General/\ set\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}C++\ Language\ Standard"{}}\ to\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}ISO\ C++20\ Standard\ (/std:c++20)"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/General/\ set\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}C\ Language\ Standard"{}}\ to\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}ISO\ C17\ (2018)\ Standard\ (/std:c17)"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/Debugging/\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Working\ Directory"{}}\ set\ to\ \$(SolutionDir)Output\(\backslash\)Executables\(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/Linker/System\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\ set\ "{}}SubSystem\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\ from\ console\ to\ Windows}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{Make\ sure\ "{}}Configuration\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\ in\ the\ top\ left\ of\ the\ window\ is\ set\ to\ "{}}Debug\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\ and\ set...}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ Configuration\ Properties/General/\ "{}}Target\ Name\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\ set\ to\ \$(ProjectName)\_DEBUG\ this\ is\ so\ that\ when\ performing\ a\ batch\ build\ and\ building\ both\ debug\ and\ release\ builds,}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ the\ debug\ executable\ doesn't\ overwrite\ the\ release\ build\ and\ both\ are\ available.}}

\end{DoxyCode}

Make the executable depend upon all required static library projects so they are built first.
Right click on the project name and select "{}Build Dependencies/Project Dependencies"{} and add...
    DavesCodeLib
This is all we have to set the project depend upon, as DavesCodeLib depends upon other libraries which are built before DavesCodeLib.

There's no need to set additional library links to "{}Linker/Input"{} set "{}Additional Dependencies"{} as we use Visual studio's
preprocessor pragma comment(lib, "{}name\_of\_lib.lib"{}) to link the libraries.

Remove the "{}Header Files"{} and "{}Source Files"{} filters, unless you wish to keep them.
\end{DoxyPre}


\doxysubsubsection*{Remove the 32bit configurations.}


\begin{DoxyPre}
Right click upon the DCP solution at the top of the solution explorer and select "{}Configuration Manager."{}
For each "{}Active Solution Configuration"{}, within "{}Active Solution Platform"{}, select "{}Edit"{} and remove the Win32 platform.
\end{DoxyPre}
